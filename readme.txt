To play A 112 Druidâ€™s Duel, download python 3. The builtin module Tkinter would be used.

After python is installed, run main.py. All other files and folders are supportive and please do not change their directories. 

Once in the game, go to tutorial first, then go back to the main page and play either the campaign or the challenges.
